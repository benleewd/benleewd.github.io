# Project Sharing
This repository is used to consolidate and host some of the projects I like to do in my free time. It is for me to track my own learning, receiving feedback to improve and to also sharing what I have learnt with others.

## About myself
I am an undergraduate based in Singapore, pursing a degree in Information System. I enjoy working on web development, Flutter and machine learning algorithms.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Flutter support web application also which makes flutter even more convenient and enticing for developers. But do note that web support is still in beta at the time of writing.
